## Code

`persons.xml` containing list of people in xml format.  
`people.xsd` containing XSD definition of persons.xml.  `

Under `src` directory there is a package `ass1` containing all classes needed 
for execution, under `generated` - generated by JAXB java classes.  

`PersonActivityXML.java` does what is described in the beginning of 
the assignment (instructions 1 and 2).  
`JAXBMarshallerPerson.java` marshalls people to `newpersons.xml` and output them to stdout.  
`JAXBUnMarshallerPerson.java` does unmarshalling from `newpersons.xml` and output on screen.  
`JsonMarshallerPersons.java` marshalls persons to `newpersons.json`.

## Execution
Run `ant execute.evaluate` to run tasks 1,2,4,5,6. Task 3 has been skipped.  
Take a look at this target in `build.xml` - it contains sub-targets for each instruction
separately.

### Additional notes

I couldn't make run JAXB with the last version of its jar, so I changed in `ivy.xml`:  
`<dependency org="javax.xml.bind" name="jaxb-api" rev="2.2.11"/>`  
`<dependency org="com.sun.xml.bind" name="jaxb-impl" rev="2.2.7"/>`  
`<dependency org="com.sun.xml.bind" name="jaxb-xjc" rev="2.2.7"/>`
